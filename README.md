# Cyberhawk Turbines Inspector
Web application for Cyberhawk 100 Turbines test. This project is running on a AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance and the whole project is running using Laravel Sail which is Laravels adoptation of Docker containers.

To create this project I used:
 - PHP / Laravel;
 - JavaScript / Vue.js;
 - AWS / Terraform;

 The fizz buzz problem is located in cyberhawk-app/database/seeders/TurbineSeeder.php which seeds the correct turbine data into the database.
